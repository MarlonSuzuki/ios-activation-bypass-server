@randomlol90 I changed the "activator.py" to stop getting the error. it was near the bottom of the document. My problem now is I'm getting a server error.

"# 2. Get GUID
self.guid = self.get_guid()"
to
" # 2. Get GUID
self.guid = self.device_info['UniqueDeviceID']"

Hi guys! I'm sorry for my English, I'm using a translator. I was able to fix all the problems you were having. I used a fork of this repository from gliddd4. Through his code, I got the GUID, then inserted it into offline_bypass.py . Then I got an error related to missing some files (BLDatabaseManager and downloads.28.sqlitedb). I took them from the bl_sbx repository, then wrote a function in the code that copies these files. After that, everything worked, the script does not give any errors, but the device does not activate. Here are the logs from my terminal.

I think @hearts4avii was taking about a different issue from what I posted. I thought they were still on the System logs part.

I did not change anything relating to the line of code you referenced. My issue is from the "Generating Payload..." step. It says "DB Gen Error: table asset has 44 columns but 43 values were supplied
[✗] Payload generation failed."

You can look at the different versions too: the .CS versions (C#) and such, its more direct then the python. I made this -- this way so people are forced to work together to make something work vs dropping an exe.

I tried your fork. It gave me the error:

[✗] Could not find GUID in logs.

I was wondering if I need to do the swap thingy "# 2. Get GUID
self.guid = self.get_guid()"
to
" # 2. Get GUID
self.guid = self.device_info['UniqueDeviceID']"

to get it to work.

I looked through the MD files and I don't see anything called book. Should I be pulling it form a Log file? The logs never generate.

That PNG file it made, is a sqlite database, add debugging to the code to tell what files are being pushed to the phone. if its pushung a PNG, it wont work. like I said a 100 times, I dont have a test device and this was put together by various leaks. and info I have. I cannot test anything but put togther what I know works, Hacktivatior has gotten this to work as is. so I know it works

Nothing to update, it cannot work offline without running a web server on your LOCAL PC or having a server to run the files.

Report on iOS Activation Server Setup
I finished modifying the original server get.php and adapted the client activator.py to work with it. As a result, I successfully achieved 100% functionality for the entire system.

The activation process consists of two clear stages:

✅ Stage 1: Initial Activation

The server-client setup is initiated.

After the first reboot, the system creates a valid downloads.28.sqlitedb database, which persists after all subsequent reboots.

Additionally, the iTunesMetadata.plist file appears at the path /var/mobile/Media/iTunes_Control/iTunes/.

The creation of these files confirms that the first stage has been successfully completed.

🔄 Intermediate Manual Action
After the first stage, you must manually copy the iTunesMetadata.plist file to the target folder:
/var/mobile/Media/Books/iTunesMetadata.plist

✅ Stage 2: Final Activation & Book Generation

After copying the file and performing a second reboot, the final activation stage occurs.

The target asset.epub file appears in the system—this is our final book.

The iTunesMetadata.plist file may be deleted by the system as it is no longer needed.

The downloads.28.sqlitedb database interacts with the server, which provides it with data from the fixedfile. As I understand it, the fixedfile contains plist keys for mobilegestalt, which are then written into the database to finalize the book's unlocking process.

Conclusion: The entire process is now fine-tuned, the server runs stably, and the final result is a fully functional asset.epub book in the system. The only way to enter a GUID manually is to read how to get it here: https://hanakim3945.github.io/posts/download28_sbx_escape/ I think the project is 80 percent complete. I'll send you my fork soon

Quite nice. I don’t have a test device so I did my best to throw together what I have.

Can you make a pull request with the proper fixes?

I got to the stage of receiving the book, but after rebooting the device did not activate. But it seems to me that I understood a lot

Same issue why you don’t use only UDID

Cause you need a specific GUID in your device BLDatabaseManager. Read the exploit POC

Yeah it just doesn’t trigger the asset.epub

I did a beta working version in my repo, but i didnt upload the server side cause it should work with some others too. Just one endpoint is needed, the ones that returns the customized sqlitedb file.

If the epub downloads ok but still not activates most of the times is related to a bad iTunesMetadata.plist

🚀 A12 Bypass Setup & Operation Guide
📋 Initial Setup

Server Configuration:
bash

Get your computer's network IP address
ipconfig getifaddr en1

Start the server (replace 192.168.0.103 with your actual IP)
cd server/
php -S 192.168.0.103:8000 -t public
2. File Configuration:

Open downloads.28.png in a text editor

Find and replace all paths to badfile.plist with your server IP

Example: http://192.168.0.103:8000/badfile.plist

🔄 Activation Process (3 Stages)
🔄 Stage 1 - Initial Activation:

The generator program automatically sends downloads.28.sqlitedb

The device will reboot after this stage

Important: Periodically delete downloads.28.sqlitedb-shm and downloads.28.sqlitedb-val files in the downloads folder before reboot

🔄 Stage 2 - Metadata Transfer:

After first reboot, the server creates iTunesMetadata.plist

Manually copy this file to /var/mobile/Media/Books/ folder

Reboot iPhone - asset.epub will appear after this

🔄 Stage 3 - Data Population:

Server receives requests like: 192.168.0.105:52588 [200]: GET /firststp/8dc56bf27aa8b527/fixedfile

The asset.epub book gets populated with data from these requests

Do not stop the server until the process fully completes!

💡 Important Notes
GUID for Generation:

Get it manually from: https://hanakim3945.github.io/posts/download28_sbx_escape/

Critical Reminders:

✅ Server must run continuously until the final reboot

✅ Don't interrupt the process after launching activator.py

✅ Monitor server logs to track progress

✅ Keep the server active throughout all stages

@csoftware-arigpt Automatic input is not working. GUID must be retrieved manually.

Modify the downloads.28.sqlitedb database with the correct path to BLDatabaseManager. We need to find the correct UUID here for the path. This can be obtained by fetching the device logarchive with command pymobiledevice3 syslog collect logs.logarchive. The resulting file can be opened in the Console.app on mac and we can find the path easily by searching for “BLDatabase”. info 2025-10-20 22:43:29.111433 +0200 bookassetd [Database]: Store is at file:///private/var/containers/Shared/SystemGroup/<UUID_HERE>/ Documents/BLDatabaseManager/BLDatabaseManager.sqlite When found, replace the path in the database with the correct one. https://hanakim3945.github.io/posts/download28_sbx_escape/ My manual video of the entire exploit process: https://drive.google.com/file/d/165U6Qnt4nE0hBkCx868-RmSnJJrHLOaH/view?usp=sharing

@xcybermanx Yes, I’ve reached the stage of obtaining the book via the exploit, but the device still hasn’t activated. Apparently, I’ve missed something—though I hope someone will review my fork and help us complete this effort. Perhaps the issue lies in the data, or maybe I overlooked a critical step.

By the way, to reliably obtain the GUID, it’s best to restore the iPhone to a clean iOS firmware first. After that, run the command:
pymobiledevice3 syslog collect logs.logarchive

Before running the command, reboot the iPhone manually. Then, open the logs.logarchive file in the Console.app on macOS and search for BLDatabaseManager—this will reveal the GUID. Note that the GUID remains constant across reboots and only changes after a full restore/re-flash. If the guid is not found, repeat this several times.

have you update downloads.28.sqlitedb before send to device ?

@xcybermanx The issue is that the file downloads.28.sqlitedb is automatically generated by a PHP-based server, with the initial data embedded in the file downloads.28.png.

Good news! The automatic GUID extraction is now working. Will be pushing an update to the repo shortly!

check the file downloads.28.sqlitedb after generated from your server & check if :
ecid
guid
product_type

has the real info of your device

@csoftware-arigpt It's better to use macOS. The automatic GUID extraction is now working in my fork! If it doesn't work on the first try, restart your iPhone manually and try again. I'll wait for your answer whether it worked or not.

@csoftware-arigpt Your iPhone must be connected to a Wi-Fi network throughout the entire process.

i have this issue before i test my code

if you have data or you want backup it update to 26.2 beta3 & backup all your data

after you need to restore it to 26.1

this only way to get it back

if no data restore it
