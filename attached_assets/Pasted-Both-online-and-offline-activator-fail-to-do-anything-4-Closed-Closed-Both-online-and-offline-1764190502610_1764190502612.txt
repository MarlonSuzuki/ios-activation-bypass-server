@randomlol90 I changed the "activator.py" to stop getting the error. it was near the bottom of the document. My problem now is I'm getting a server error.

"# 2. Get GUID
self.guid = self.get_guid()"
to
" # 2. Get GUID
self.guid = self.device_info['UniqueDeviceID']"

@SheLuvsTripp It gets to the "Requesting Payload..." step and then says "[X] Server Error:" I could be adding the link in wrong. I don't know anything about any of this, but I've been working on it the last two days. lol I want to get the right.

i have this issue before i test my code

if you have data or you want backup it update to 26.2 beta3 & backup all your data

after you need to restore it to 26.1

this only way to get it back

if no data restore it
